In this project, users can add photos they take to their current location on the map. My main goal in this project is to collaborate with my mentor to develop testable code using the MVVM architecture and SOLID principles, making sure that the application performs reliably and effectively. I created thorough unit tests during this process to guarantee the software's quality, which greatly improved the application's stability and long-term viability.
